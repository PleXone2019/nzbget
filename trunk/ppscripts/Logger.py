### NZBGET POST-PROCESSING SCRIPT                                          ###

# Save post-processing log into a file.

# This script saves post-processing log of nzb-file into file
# _postprocesslog.txt in the destination directory.

# NOTE: This script requires Python to be installed on your system.
