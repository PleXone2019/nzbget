#######################    Usage instructions     #######################
# 1. To use this script with nzbget set the option "PostProcess" in
#    nzbget configuration file to point to this script file. E.g.:
#        PostProcess=/home/user/nzbget/postprocess-example.sh
#
# 2. The script supports the feature called "delayed par-check".
#    That means it can try to unpack downloaded files without par-checking
#    them fisrt. Only if unpack fails, the script schedules par-check,
#    then unpacks again.
#    To use delayed par-check set following options in nzbget configuration file:
#        ParCheck=no
#        ParRepair=yes
#        LoadPars=one (or) LoadPars=all
#
# 3. If you want to par-check/repair all files before trying to unpack them,
#    set option "ParCheck=yes".
#
# 4. There are few user-configurable settings in the script.
#    See the next section.

# NZBGet passes following arguments to postprocess-programm as environment
# variables:
#  NZBPP_DIRECTORY    - path to destination dir for downloaded files;
#  NZBPP_NZBFILENAME  - name of processed nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_PARFILENAME  - name of par-file or empty string (if no collections were 
#                       found);
#  NZBPP_PARSTATUS    - result of par-check:
#                       0 = not checked: par-check disabled or nzb-file does
#                           not contain any par-files;
#                       1 = checked and failed to repair;
#                       2 = checked and successfully repaired;
#                       3 = checked and can be repaired but repair is disabled;
#  NZBPP_NZBCOMPLETED - state of nzb-job:
#                       0 = there are more collections in this nzb-file queued;
#                       1 = this was the last collection in nzb-file;
#  NZBPP_PARFAILED    - indication of failed par-jobs for current nzb-file:
#                       0 = no failed par-jobs;
#                       1 = current par-job or any of the previous par-jobs for
#                           the same nzb-files failed;
#  NZBPP_CATEGORY     - category assigned to nzb-file (can be empty string).
